    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
        As a current BA Psychology and Information Studies student at the University of Ghana. A highly motivated and adaptable individual with many skills, including technical expertise and artistic abilities. My experience spans the full spectrum of web development, from front-end design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to back-end development, leveraging server-side logic and database management. I have practical full-stack experience building projects, such as [mention a project or two if possible]. I have a solid grasp of user interface and user experience principles, in addition to my technical abilities. I have gained valuable hands-on experience through internships, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. My creative pursuits extend to acting on set, where I honed not only my communication and adaptability, but also a keen understanding of character development and role-playing. Also, internships at the Ghana Hajj Board and the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority gave me invaluable experience in community engagement and data analysis. I am confident in my ability to contribute creatively and effectively to any team.
